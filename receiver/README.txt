## Overview

The design consists of several components. If any alterations are needed they
should be done on the individual components. From there they can be imported to
the 'main-body'.

FreeCAD is not great when it comes to editing sections of a sketch that have
been done so it appears better to take this modular approach way.

There are several seperate sections


## Inlay Housing
### Housing
This is a pillar which takes a screw inlay.

## Voltage Regulator Bracket
### voltage-regulator-bracket
This provides a base for the voltage regulator. 

This is reinforced as it may get tugged on and it's also relatively heavy and
could damage other components if moved.

## SSD Regulator
### relay-bracket

Provides a base for the SSD Relay

Same reasons as Voltage regulator
